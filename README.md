# eBERlight Research Archive

Comprehensive archive and analysis of the [eBERlight](https://eberlight.aps.anl.gov) program
at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source (APS).

## What is eBERlight?

**e**nabling **B**iological and **E**nvironmental **R**esearch with **light** — a DOE BER program
providing integrated X-ray capabilities for biological and environmental science at the
upgraded APS (500× brighter X-rays since 2024).
