# Synchrotron Data Analysis Notes

Personal study notes on synchrotron X-ray data analysis and AI/ML methods
at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source (APS).

## About

Notes covering the DOE BER program's integrated X-ray capabilities for biological
and environmental science at the upgraded APS (500× brighter X-rays since 2024).
