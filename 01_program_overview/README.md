# eBERlight Program Overview

## Mission

**eBERlight** (**e**nabling **B**iological and **E**nvironmental **R**esearch with **light**) is a
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) program
at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source (APS). The program provides integrated,
world-class X-ray capabilities specifically designed to address fundamental questions in
biological and environmental science.

eBERlight leverages the upgraded APS (APS-U), which delivers X-ray beams up to 500× brighter
than before, enabling unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution for studying complex
biological and environmental systems.

## History & Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **2023 Q4** | eBERlight program officially launched with DOE BER approval |
| **2024 Q2** | APS-U upgrade construction completed; $815M investment |
| **2024 Q3** | APS resumes operations with 4th-generation MBA lattice |
| **2024 Q4** | eBERlight beamlines begin commissioning and early user operations |
| **2024 Nov** | eBERlight 101 Workshop — introduction for new users |
| **2025 Q1** | FICUS (Facilities Integrating Collaborations for User Science) partnership expands |
| **2025 Q2** | Full user operations across all 15 eBERlight beamlines |

## Research Domains

eBERlight supports seven interconnected research domains:

1. **Soil Science** — Soil organic matter cycling, mineral-organic interactions, rhizosphere processes
2. **Plant Science** — Root architecture, nutrient uptake, plant-microbe interactions
3. **Environmental Chemistry** — Contaminant speciation, biogeochemical cycling, heavy metal transport
4. **Microbiology** — Microbial community structure, single-cell analysis, biofilm formation
5. **Structural Biology** — Protein crystallography, enzyme mechanisms, macromolecular complexes
6. **Climate Science** — Atmospheric aerosol characterization, ice core analysis, carbon sequestration
7. **Geochemistry** — Mineral transformations, fluid-rock interactions, nuclear waste forms

## FICUS Program Integration

The **FICUS** (Facilities Integrating Collaborations for User Science) program enables
researchers to access multiple DOE user facilities through a single proposal. eBERlight
participates in FICUS partnerships that combine APS X-ray capabilities with:

- **EMSL** (Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory) — mass spectrometry, NMR, microscopy
- **JGI** (Joint Genome Institute) — genomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics
- **NEON** (National Ecological Observatory Network) — ecological field data, remote sensing

This integration allows researchers to study the same samples across multiple length scales
and analytical modalities, from atomic structure (APS) to molecular composition (EMSL) to
genomic function (JGI) to ecosystem context (NEON).

## Program Organization

eBERlight is organized around:

- **15 dedicated beamlines** spanning crystallography, imaging, microscopy, spectroscopy, and scattering
- **7 partner facilities** providing complementary analytical capabilities
- **Integrated data management** connecting experimental data across facilities
- **User support infrastructure** including sample preparation, data analysis, and training
